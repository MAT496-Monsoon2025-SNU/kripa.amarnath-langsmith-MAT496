This topic, sometimes referred to as "Sessions" in tracing systems, is mentioned as a way to group multiple traces from a 
single user interaction.

-Purpose: 
        In conversational applications (like chatbots), a user's experience is not a single question-and-answer but a series 
        of back-and-forth turns. The concept of a Conversational Thread groups these sequential Traces together.

-Grouping: 
         It allows all the individual traces that occur over the lifetime of a user's single session to be logically linked.

-Debugging Benefit: 
                  This grouping is critical for debugging issues that only arise over time, such as a model losing track of history or 
introducing hallucinations after many turns. Instead of examining single turns, you can review the entire context of the conversation.
