This stage involves aggregating and reviewing the individual run results to derive insights about the overall application performance.

1.Individual Run Review: You can drill down into a specific run to see the original input, the application's step-by-step trace, the 
  final output, and the scores from all evaluators for that run. This helps with debugging and error analysis.

2.Summary Metrics: The primary goal is to look at aggregated metrics to determine the application's overall performance.

3.Confidence in Changes: By comparing the summary metrics of a new experiment against a previous one, you gain empirical 
  evidence to confidently conclude whether a code change improved or degraded performance, allowing you to push updates 
  to production with greater certainty.
