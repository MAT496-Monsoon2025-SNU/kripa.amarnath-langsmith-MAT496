This is a critical feature for practical development, where you need to choose between two or more competing versions of your application.
-Core Function: 
              It allows you to select two or more completed experiments and view their summary metrics and individual run results 
              on the same screen.
-Decision Making:
                You can see if Experiment A scored 85% accuracy while Experiment B scored 92% accuracy, making the decision to 
                adopt B straightforward.
-Deep Dive: 
           For a more nuanced view, you can compare the traces of the same test case side-by-side to understand why one version 
           performed better than the other.
