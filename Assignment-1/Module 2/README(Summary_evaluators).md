While not a dedicated tool, the concept refers to the final output of the entire evaluation process.

-Aggregation: After an experiment runs and individual evaluators score each of the hundreds or thousands of test cases, the system 
             aggregates these scores.

-Reporting: The final result is a summary report that shows metrics like: Average Latency, Error Rate, Overall Accuracy, or the 
            Mean Score of an LLM-as-a-Judge metric. This summary is what is used for the high-level comparison in pairwise experiments.
